# Competitiveness with Jupyter

## This is a test notebook for learning Jupyter. 

### I explore data from the World Economic Forum on national competitiveness and compare it to data from the Social Progress Index on human welfare, to see how the two measures compare. 

To respect WEF's data terms of use I have not included copies of the data here. They can be downloaded at:
